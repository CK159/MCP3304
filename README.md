# SPI with Arduino and MCP3304  

An upgraded example sketch based on http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/MCP3208  
This has:  
Pinout for connecting an Arduino Leonardo to MCP3304 and SPI Devices in general  
Better example/testing usage of the MCP3304 (reads all channels, averages values, prints results)  
Easily see processor time spent processing and sleeping  
Some test results for various achievable sample rates at different SPI clock speeds  
More/better comments in a few places
